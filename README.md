# iOS Apps Developed in CSE 438
This repository is a collection of 4 iOS apps that were developed over the course of taking an iOS mobile application course at Washington University in St. Louis. These apps range from a simple shopping cart calculator to a movie browsing assistant. The curriculum can be found [here](https://www.arl.wustl.edu/~todd/cse438/index.html).

## Getting Started
The code in this repository is written in Swift 3 and was developed in Xcode 9.3. Therefore, ensure that the Xcode version is at least version 9.3 when attempting to compile and test the apps. App 2 was developed specifically to adjust to different screen sizes and iOS devices, but Apps 1, 3, and 4 were only developed and tested on an iPhone 8 simulation. Therefore, it is advised to select iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus as the simulator in general.
