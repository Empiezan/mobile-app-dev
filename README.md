# iOS Apps Developed in CSE 438
This repository is a collection of 4 iOS apps that were developed over the course of taking an iOS mobile application course at Washington University in St. Louis. Each app was developed in about 1-2 weeks and focused on learning new tools from the Swift API. These apps range from a simple shopping cart calculator to a movie browsing assistant. The curriculum can be found [here](https://www.arl.wustl.edu/~todd/cse438/index.html).

## Getting Started
### Xcode 9.3
The code in this repository is written in Swift 3 and was developed in Xcode 9.3. Therefore, ensure that the Xcode version is at least version 9.3 when attempting to compile and test the apps. 
### Running apps on iPhone or Simulator 
App 2 was developed specifically to adjust to different screen sizes and iOS devices, but Apps 1, 3, and 4 were only developed and tested on an iPhone 8 simulation. Therefore, it is advised to select iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus as the simulator in general. 

### App/Lab 1: Shopping Cart Calculator
An app to keep track of shopping cart items and the running total. The app consists of two main views: a form and a tableview. In the form, users can supply information such as the name of the item, quantity, discounts, and taxes. The tableview displays the items that users have submitted from the form, shows the running total, and allows users to delete individual items or all items.
